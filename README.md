# vimLikeElectronWebBrowser

> A work-in-progress vim-like electron-based web browser

Warning: This project is a work in progress, its created and maintained by me, Ehan, *a literal 13 year old*, and as of right now this project doesn't even exist. Nothing is finished or even started, I'll add more to it when I have the time. If you're reading this, then theres nothing to see here for now.

## The Idea

### The Context

I'm a *die-hard linux user*, open source enthusiast, tiled window manager user, and ***average vim enjoyer***.

My whole setup is fully keyboard-operated, fancy, and vim-like. I use Debain (Linux), bspwm, kitty, ranger (sometimes nemo and gtk.FileChooser), and neovim. (And I use my own colorscheme, [purpurite](https://purpurite.ehan.dev))

However, theres one thing I haven't yet *riced* to full *vim-ness* and *fancy-ness*: my web browser.

### The Problem

The problem is Chrome is difficult to *rice* or *modify*, yet it's the most common and most supported web browser. Although Chromium is open source and its source code can be edited and recompiled, doing such is very difficult.

There are a variety of vim-like, open source, browsers. However, many websites and webapps do not support them since they use less popular chromium derratives such as QtWebKit and others.

### The Solution

What if... Electron
